# Quickrate

A tool to allow the quick selection of photos from an album
I made this to allow someone I took pictures of to select the ones they liked, but I'm  sure there are lots of other applications.

## Usage

Set this up on a webserver that supports PHP, and install the dependencies with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
Make sure the server has write permission for the data directory, otherwise the ratings won't get saved.

Albums are added with the `ingest.py src nickname password` command.  
`src` is a path to a directory containing the images you want to import  
`nickname` is a name displayed in a list of albums that have laready been opened on this computer, so they can be quickly opened again  
`password` is a phrase appended to the end of the "password" generated by the script  
If nothing goes wrong, the script will print the password you can give to people for them to view the album.

## Seeing which photos are selected

The `/selected` page looks very similar to the main page, but if the password string is entered, it displays which photos have been selected.
